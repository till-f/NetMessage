# NetMessage
**Typesafe and lightweight RPC for .NET**

*NetMessage* is a small, super easy to use RPC and messaging library. This package, *NetMessage.Base*, contains the lower
protocol layer that is used by the main package. It provides the fundamental abstractions for messages, requests and responses
as well as the corresponding base classes that implement everything for proper event based message handling. Therefore, the
*NetMessage.Base* package may also support others to implement ready-to-use clients and servers for custom protocols.
