# NetMessage
**Typesafe and lightweight RPC for .NET**

*NetMessage* is a small and easy to use RPC and messaging library. This package, *NetMessage.Base*, contains the lower
protocol layer that is used by the main package. This includes the fundamental abstractions for messages, requests and responses
as well as base classes for servers and clients that fully implement the corresponding event based message handling. Take the
*NetMessage.Base* package to create ready-to-use clients and/or servers for custom TCP protocols.
